# The Musicoin Bounty Program

Musicoin ($MUSIC) Desktop Wallet(MDW) is an open source project to support end users to transfer $MUSIC between wallets.

The core development team is tasked with upgrading and improving the blockchain, the web app and a mobile app. This has shifted the focus of the project away from the MDW, and toward other applications more targeted to widening the spread of adoption and community in the ecosystem.

Issues that have a bounty are marked with two labels. Firstly, a cyan bounty label denotes that an issue has a bounty reward associated with it. Secondly, the amount of the reward in $MUSIC. Should you find that one of the bounty issues falls into your wheelhouse; by all means, submit a PR! There is no need to claim the issue or request to be assigned.

## Contributing

1. Quality is preferred over turnover time; naturally. So put some effort in and make your patch awesome.
2. We would be more than happy to lend assistance if need be. You can find us at the official Slack or Discord.
3. To claim your bounty, you're required to sign the Musicoin CLA. This will be presented to you if your PR is merged.
4. New issues can be submitted at any time, the team will review and assign a bounty if needed.
5. Teamwork is encouraged. If two people work together to fix an issue, both will be rewarded in proportion to their contribution. So pool your skills, and maybe you'll come up with something we didn't.
6. Comment and fully document your work.

The bounty program is open for all, beginner or experienced. Issues that we think are good tasks for beginners are labelled as a "good first issue", with an appropriate bounty. The awarded amount may increase depending on the difficulty and urgency of the issue presented. All decisions regarding bounties fall solely to the discretion of the Musicoin core team.
