# The Musicoin Bounty Program

Musicoin ($MUSIC) Desktop Wallet(MDW) is an open source project to support end users to transfer $MUSIC between wallets. So far, the project is drumming up quite a bit of interest. So help out! (Pun intended.)

The core development team is tasked with upgrading and improving the blockchain itself, the web app, and a mobile app. This has shifted the focus of the project away from the MDW, and toward other applications more targeted to widening the spread of adoption and community in the ecosystem.

And here is where you come in! We have created a bounty program for you to help out with your own contributions. If you want to hack on this codebase, read on!! We appreciate your interest in the project, and your effort into the project.

Issues that have a bounty are marked with two labels. Firstly, a cyan bounty label denotes that an issue has a bounty reward associated with it. Secondly, the amount of the reward in $MUSIC. Should you find that one of the bounty issues falls into your wheelhouse; by all means, submit a PR!

## Contributing

1. Quality is preferred over turnover time; naturally. So put some effort in, and make your patch awesome.
2. We would be more than happy to lend assistance if need be. You can find us at the official Slack or Discord.
3. To claim your bounty, you're required to sign the Musicoin CLA. This will be presented to you if your PR is merged.
4. New issues can be submitted at any time, the team will review and assign a bounty if needed.
5. Teamwork is encouraged. If two people work together to fix an issue, both will be rewarded in proportion to their contribution. So pool your skills, and maybe you'll come up with something we didn't.
6. Comment and fully document your work! This isn't to impose more hoops for you to jump though, but is in the interest of the others who may code on that file next. Make sure to attempt a solid explanation of anything that is not reasonably intuitive.

The bounty program is open for all, beginner or experienced. Issues that we think could be a good task for somebody first starting out are labelled a "good first issue", with an appropriate bounty. The awarded amount may increase depending on the difficulty and urgency of the issue presented. All decisions regarding bounties fall solely to the discression of the Musicoin core team.
