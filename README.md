# Running the App

1. Start [gmc](https://github.com/Musicoin/go-musicoin) `gmc --rpc --rpcapi="db,eth,net,web3,personal" --rpcport "8545" --rpcaddr "127.0.0.1" --rpccorsdomain "localhost"`
2. Start IPFS: `ipfs daemon`
3. Run `nw` in the root of the repo. Note: If you're on macOS/OSX, you wouldn't be able to setup `nw` courtesy [this bug](https://github.com/nwjs/npm-installer/issues/56). In this case, download `nwjs@0.20.0` for testing

# Packaging the App
<<<<<<< HEAD

1. Install nwjs-builder: `npm install nwjs-builder -g`
2. Package the app: `nwb nwbuild -v 0.17.4 -p win64,osx64,linux64 -o build --side-by-side`
3. Update `geth` and `ipfs` executables for each platform. See links below for obtaining the files

# Packaging Dependencies

If you have the dependencies ready to go in a directory, you can just copy them into the bin directory generated by the builder command. In this example, the builder was given an output folder of `C:\tmp\mc-mvp3`, and the dependencies are stored in `C:\tmp\mc-mvp3\dependencies\`. Clearly a build script is needed...

```
robocopy C:\tmp\mc-mvp3\dependencies\win64 C:\tmp\mc-mvp3\Musicoin-wallet-win-x64\bin /S
robocopy C:\tmp\mc-mvp3\dependencies\osx64 C:\tmp\mc-mvp3\Musicoin-wallet-osx-x64\bin /S
robocopy C:\tmp\mc-mvp3\dependencies\linux64 C:\tmp\mc-mvp3\Musicoin-wallet-linux-x64\bin /S
```
