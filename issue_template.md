# Go through this before opening an issue

## See whether there are similar issues and comment there if you face the same problem. Opening duplicate issues will only delay help.

### Issue title must be [Operating System] [Release number] Issue
e.g. [macOS] [1.0] Wallet Doesn't Open
This allows us to filter issues way faster, suggest potential fixes and fix them quickly

### Checklist
1. Mention your Operating system. Without it, we pretty much can't do anything.
2. Attach screenshots, redact your public key if needed.
3. Mention expected behaviour, sometimes, we can't figure out what you mean just from the issue title
4. Please have a proper issue title. "WALLET NOT OPENING!!!" is an example of a bad issue title
